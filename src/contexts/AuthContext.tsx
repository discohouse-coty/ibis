// Remove any React Context logic here

// You can still add other context-related logic here if needed,
// but for Firebase Auth, use the zustand store directly.

// Example: You might still want to export a provider for other context-related things
// if you have them.

export {}; // Prevents TypeScript errors if you don't export anything else.
